fitgirl-repacks.site is THE ONLY official site of my repacks. All other “mirrors” (fitgirlrepacks.co, fitgirl-repacks.cc, repack-fitgirl.com, fitgirl-repack.com, etc.) are ALL fakes, made to infect you with malware, show you tons of ads and get your money as donations. Make sure to enable redirection to the real site at the end of the installation.

  Cyberpunk 2077
  Release Date: December 10, 2020
  Genres/Tags: Action, RPG, First-person, Third-person, 3D
  Developer: CD Projekt RED, QLOC
  Publisher: CD Projekt RED
  Engine: RED Engine 4
  Crack: GOG DRM-free/CODEX (Steam)
  
  Repack Features:
Based on Cyberpunk.2077-CODEX ISO release: codex-cyberpunk.2077.iso (59,890,204,672 bytes)
Cyberpunk.2077.Language.Pack-CODEX (47.3 GB) added
Game version is v1.03, which equals to Day 1 patch
Bonus "The World of Cyberpunk 2077" in PDF format (435 MB) added
GOG-specific files added as an option; GOG registry entries recreated for compatibility with future GOG patches
You can switch from default CODEX (Steam) version to GOG one and vice versa by running corresponding .BAT files in the game root. Many users report better perfomance on GOG version, so consider it a priority
Special fix for older CPUs without AVX support is available in "AVX Fix" folder after installation, it removes most of AVX-related crashes
100% Lossless & MD5 Perfect: all files are identical to originals after installation (ONLY when installed with credits video and all voiceovers)
NOTHING ripped, NOTHING re-encoded
Selective Download feature: you may skip downloading and installing of credits video, bonus content (contains The World of Cyberpunk 2077 PDF, OST, Avatars, Wallpapers, Posters, Short Story and Sourcebook) and voiceovers you don't need
Significantly smaller archive size (compressed from cumulative 103.5 to 35.2~79.6 GB, depending on selected components)
Installation takes (one language, no credits, no bonus content): ~45 minutes on 16-threads CPU; ~1 hour 25 minutes on 8-threads CPU; ~2 hours 30 minutes on 4-threads CPU
After-install integrity check so you could make sure that everything installed properly
HDD space after installation: up to 108.6 GB
Language can be changed in game settings; the game tends to "forget" the language you've chosen on each launch - to fix it edit "bin\x64\steam_emu.ini" (Steam version) or "goggame-1423049311.info" (GOG), so the game would default to the language of your choice
To activate pre-order DLC items switch the game to GOG version, go to "bin\x64" folder, rename "GameServicesGOG.dll" to "GameServicesGOG-.dll", run the game, copy URL for registration on cyberpunk.net, follow it, register with fake login/email/password. Switch to game - now you have items claimed. PROFIT! Thanks to Twingo!
